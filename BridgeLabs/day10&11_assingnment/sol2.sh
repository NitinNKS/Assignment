 Flip Coin Simulation - This problem displays the winner Heads or Tails

 uc -1 : As a Simulator start with Flipping a Coin to Display Heads or
 Tails as winner - Use ((RANDOM)) to find Heads or Tails - Name the file flipCoinSimulator.sh

uc -2 : As a simulator, loop through Multiple times of flipping a coin
and show number of times head and tail has won

uc -3 : Modify the earlier UC 2 to continue till either of them have won 21
times. Show if itâ€™s a Win or Tie. If Win then who won and by how much

uc -4 : Extend UC 3 to ensure if its tie then the game continues till the
difference of minimum 2 points is achieved
